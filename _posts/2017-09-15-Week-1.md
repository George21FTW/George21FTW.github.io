    <td>I learnt by using the resources available such as the classroom where the set up manual was. This helped me a lot as I couldn't of done my page without it. Also I used my IPad to speed up the process and I was much more effective when it came to getting on with the work.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Technology is a brilliant thing but at the best of times. I get distracted too easily by my computer instead of focusing on my iPad where the instructions were. I probably wouldn't of had to use the extra recourse on classroom if I had looked where I was supposed to for a minority of my time doing it at home..</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will change my focus by getting on with my work as soon as it is set rather than what is on my phone. This will help me because that means I have less homework over the week.</td>
